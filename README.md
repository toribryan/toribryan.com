## Getting started

Requires Node 24.16.0 (see `.nvmrc`).

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The site runs at http://localhost:3000.

| Script                 | What it does               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`          | Dev server                 |
| `npm run build`        | Production build           |
| `npm run start`        | Serve the production build |
| `npm run check-types`  | `tsc --noEmit`             |
| `npm run lint`         | ESLint                     |
| `npm run format:write` | Prettier                   |

Pages prerender statically; only the login route and its form handler run on
demand. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` for configuration —
`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` overrides the canonical origin used in metadata and
JSON-LD, and analytics IDs are optional and inert when unset.

## Password gate

Set `SITE_PASSWORD` and every route redirects to `/login` until the password is
entered. Leave it unset and the site is open, which is what keeps local dev and
preview deploys usable without a secret.

```bash
# .env.local
SITE_PASSWORD=your-password-here
```

A successful login sets an httpOnly cookie holding an expiring HMAC token —
`<expiry>.<signature>`, signed with the password — so a leaked cookie expires on
its own and can't be cracked back into the password. Sessions last 30 days.
**Changing `SITE_PASSWORD` invalidates every existing session**, which is how you
sign everyone out.

On Vercel, set it in Project Settings → Environment Variables. Gating a preview
deploy but not production is just a matter of which environments you set it in.

## What's where

```
src/
  app/(app)/(pages)/    list pages — /components, /latest
  app/(app)/(docs)/     doc detail routes — /components/[slug], /latest/[slug], /work/[slug]
  features/doc/         MDX content layer, cards, and the shared doc page shell
    content/            ← all long-form content lives here
  features/portfolio/   home page sections and their data
  components/           shared UI (base/ui = Base UI, ui = local)
  config/site.ts        nav and site metadata
  styles/globals.css    design tokens and prose styles
```

## Adding content

Content is file-based MDX. The folder a file sits in determines its category and
its route — there's no index to register it in.

```
src/features/doc/content/
  components/   → /components/<slug>    one doc per brand design system
  latest/       → /latest/<slug>        posts and creative retros
  work/         → /work/<slug>          case studies
```

Drop in a new `.mdx` file with frontmatter and it appears:

```mdx
---
title: "Rabbit run"
description: "A Snake-style game in isometric line art."
createdAt: "2026-10-05"
updatedAt: "2026-10-06"
role: "Designer and engineer"
type: "Game"
period: "Q4 2026"
skills: ["Interaction Design", "SVG", "React"]
---

## The puzzle

Body copy, tables, images and fenced code all render.
```

`title`, `description`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` are required; everything else
is optional and drives the facts block, cover card, and metadata. The full
contract with per-field notes is `src/features/doc/types/document.ts`.

Images resolve against `public/`. Sorting is newest-first by `createdAt`, with
`pinned: true` floating an entry to the top.

Résumé sections — experience, education, awards, certifications, tech stack —
are typed arrays in `src/features/portfolio/data/` rather than MDX.

If this repo ever goes public, that's worth making explicit rather than leaving
