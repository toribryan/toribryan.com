   * Everything is gated except the login route itself, its form handler, Next's

   * browser fetches them *for the login page* — gate them and the tab shows a
   * broken icon to anyone who hasn't signed in yet.
   *
   * `og-cover.png` is public for the same reason: a link preview is fetched by
   * iMessage or Slack with no cookie, so a gated card renders as a blank box.
   * It is a designed card, not site content, so nothing private leaks.
   *
   * Content under `public/` is otherwise deliberately included: an unlisted
   * case-study image is still private. `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` stay
   * gated too, so the URL list isn't readable from outside.
