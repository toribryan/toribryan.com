 * in a quick burst skip straight to the rage clicks, and so does any line he
 * would repeat before he has called them out; after that his lines can come
 * round again. A visitor who lingers without clicking gets a hello. The
 * first poke bursts him apart, and once he's back together he says "WOAH".
