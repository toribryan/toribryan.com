# toribryan.com

Tori Bryan's portfolio — Next.js 16 (App Router) + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4.

Built on the [chanhdai.com](https://github.com/ncdai/chanhdai.com) portfolio
template (MIT), stripped to the portfolio slice and rebranded. **Attribution in
`src/components/site-footer-cad.tsx` is required by `TRADEMARK.md` — do not
remove it.** The remaining `chanhdai`/`ncdai` strings in `icons.tsx`,
`site-footer-cad.tsx` and the `prose-ncdai` utility are intentional.

## Development

```
npm run dev           # dev server on :3000
npm run build         # production build
npm run check-types   # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint          # eslint
npm run format:write  # prettier
```

Node version is pinned in `.nvmrc` (24.16.0). Before calling work done, run
`check-types` **and** `build` — typed routes mean some errors only surface once
`next build` regenerates `.next/types`. A bare `tsc` on a clean tree will report
false `Route` errors until then.

## Content lives in MDX, not in TypeScript

All page content is file-based under `src/features/doc/content/<category>/*.mdx`.
The category is derived from the folder name, never declared in frontmatter.

| Folder        | Route            | Holds                           |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `components/` | none (archived)  | One doc per brand design system |
| `latest/`     | `/latest/[slug]` | Posts and creative retros       |
| `work/`       | `/work/[slug]`   | Case studies                    |

fibo's special components are a separate feature. The parts themselves are
installed as source from fibo's registry into `src/components/fibo/` (`npx
shadcn@latest add https://fibo.toribryan.com/r/<name>.json --path
src/components/fibo`); re-run that to update one, and check its imports still
point at `@/components/fibo/`; the install also drops a stray `utils.ts`
and a `cn` package, and writes dark values for fibo's extra roles into
`globals.css` that this site mixes itself, so revert those, but keep `--warning` and the three `--sticker-*` tokens
(edge, ink and shadow) that Sticker avatar needs and the `--particle-shadow` that
Reactions' flying emoji use, and the three `--glass-*` tokens of Floating nav's
glass variant, which this site declares itself. `src/lib/merge-refs.ts` is fibo's `mergeRefs`,
which Integration visual and Token flow import as
`@/lib/merge-refs`. `field-size.ts` (Input and Input group) and
`format-count.ts` (Count, and Jump bar) and `dates.ts` (Calendar and Date
picker) are fibo's helpers the same way. Rich text editor runs on Tiptap
(`@tiptap/react`, `@tiptap/starter-kit`, `@tiptap/extensions` and the
`@tiptap/pm` peer, at fibo's versions), fibo's one other named dependency
besides Data table's TanStack. Three parts carry local changes. `chapter-scrubber.tsx` keeps `preview="none"`,
which fibo dropped, for a rail with no preview at all; the home page cover
and its doc use it. `command-menu.tsx` shows its preview pane by the dialog's own width
(`@xl/command-menu`) rather than the viewport's, and widens for it at any
viewport (`data-preview:max-w-3xl`, where fibo has `sm:`), so the pane stays in the
scaled cover on a phone. `voice-memo.tsx` has a `device` prop that puts
any element inside its record button in place of the flat drawing, and a
`panelClassName` for placing the transcript, and an `onCopy` callback,
and its copy and download buttons carry words ("Copy", "Download .md")
beside their icons, and closing the transcript plays an exit before it's
removed and hands focus back to the device, with `onDismiss` as it starts
and `onDismissed` once it's gone (tidying each settled phrase,
`tidyPhrase`, is fibo's own now); with a custom device the button draws no focus ring, so the device draws
its own. The Voice memo project page (`/work/voice-memo`) and its bare
`/voice-memo` page use all three for the 3D device, in
`features/doc/components/voice-memo-hero.tsx` (the device itself, which the
card cover also draws, is in `voice-memo-device.tsx`). It isn't in
`fibo-niche.ts`, so it has no `/components` doc yet. Put
these back after reinstalling. `filter-menu.tsx` matches fibo again: its
`container` prop and scrolling the list rather than the page, which the
home page cover needs, are both in fibo now. So does `token-flow.tsx`,
whose `orientation` prop the Design System Overhaul card cover stacks its
tiers with, and the scrubber's screen fitting and the command menu's `modal`
prop, which the home page cover and the command menu doc use, are in fibo
too. `src/features/portfolio/data/fibo-niche.ts`
lists the parts with a page here, which drives the home page section and the
docs; `home: false` keeps a part off the home page (Token flow, Reactions, whose slot Floating nav took, Integration visual, whose slot the Command menu took after Data table joined, and Chapter scrubber, whose slot Chat composer took). Each has a doc at `/components/[slug]`, ported from fibo's Storybook:
`src/features/components/content/<slug>.mdx` is the body,
`examples/<slug>.tsx` holds its live examples (named after the fibo stories
they port), and `data/registry.tsx` wires the lead preview and links. The
MDX renders with JS expressions allowed, since fibo's doc blocks take
arrays and elements as props; `components/doc-blocks.tsx` and
`doc-parts.tsx` are everything it can use. Adding one means installing the
part, a `fibo-niche.ts` entry, an MDX file, an examples module and a home
page cover in `features/portfolio/components/components/covers.tsx`.
Data table brings
fibo's Table, Checkbox, Avatar, Tooltip, Button, Input, Menu, Sheet and
Pagination into `src/components/fibo/`, written from their registry JSON
rather than the CLI, so they can't land in `components/ui/`. It runs on
TanStack Table v9 (`@tanstack/react-table` and `@tanstack/react-store`, at
fibo's versions): a table is made with `useDataTable` and a column helper
and passed as `<DataTable table={table}>`; the old `rowIds` and
hand-written-row API is deprecated in fibo and unused here. The home cover
animates by calling `table.setRowSelection`, and the doc's URL-synced
example keeps its state in the query string with `useSearchParamsAtom`. Its examples' badges use
`success-subtle`, `warning-subtle` and `info-subtle`, which this site mixes
in `globals.css` like `destructive-subtle`.

fibo has two pages here. `/components` lists every fibo part under its
shelf, special first, A to Z, except Pixel snail and Map pin (`HIDDEN` in
`fibo-catalog.ts`; their old pages redirect to `/components`), with an
install block per package manager (`fibo-install.tsx`) above. The parts come
from `data/fibo-catalog.json`, a copy of fibo's `components.meta.json` that
`npm run sync:fibo-catalog` refreshes (it reads `../fibo`, or `--repo`);
re-run it whenever fibo adds or regroups a part. A part with a page here opens
it and shows its cover; the rest open fibo's Storybook (`fiboStorybookUrl` in
`fibo-catalog.ts` builds the URL from the shelf and group) and show a still
preview from `catalog-previews.tsx`, ported from fibo's Catalog cards; `/components/all`
redirects there. `/fibo` is the lore: `FiboHero` with `variant="page"` (an
`h1`, and buttons out to the Storybook, Figma and GitHub), then
`fibo-story.tsx`, with the rabbit farm (`fibo-farm.tsx`) that steps through
Fibonacci's puzzle and the dither plates in `public/images/fibo/`. On the
home page the hero's buttons go to those two pages instead, and in place of
the golden-rectangle construction and the pixel rabbit it shows the component
desk (`iso/component-desk.tsx`) beside the copy: the rabbit with working
design system parts and a monitor that shows the code for the last one used.
`iso/rabbit-run.tsx` is a Snake-style game on the golden tiling whose family
grows by Fibonacci. Both draw from `iso/iso.ts`, isometric line art as SVG
strings, and their keys only work while the scene has focus.

The phone nav is fibo's Floating nav (`src/components/fibo/floating-nav.tsx`,
installed and documented like the parts above).
The site uses its compact `size="sm"`; the file matches the registry as is.
`nav-mobile-bar.tsx` shows `MOBILE_NAV` from `config/site.ts` in it as words
(items with no icon), with a round menu button beside it (`nav-mobile.tsx`)
listing every page in `MOBILE_MENU`; the two hide together on scroll. Below `sm` it replaces the header's
links, so `ScrollToTop` only shows from `sm` up. If `shadcn add` stops on
pnpm's ignored-build warning before writing the file, copy `files[0].content`
from the item's JSON into `src/components/fibo/` instead.

`src/components/ui/token-flow.tsx`, the site's own copy, still backs the
archived review deck; `.21st/token-flow.tsx` is generated from it by `npm run
sync:token-flow` for 21st.dev.

The portfolio review deck is archived: its `/review` route was removed, but
`src/features/review/` remains, since case studies use its slides through
`components/mdx-review-artifacts.tsx`, and the deck can be restored by
reverting that commit.

The brand design system docs under `components/` are archived: their list
and detail routes and the nav link were removed, but the MDX and
`getComponentDocs` remain so they can be restored by reverting that commit.
They are unrelated to fibo's special components, which now own the
`/components/[slug]` route.

`src/features/doc/data/documents.ts` reads them; `src/features/doc/types/document.ts`
is the frontmatter contract. **To add content, add an MDX file** — there is no
array to update and no registration step. Adding a new top-level folder creates
a new category, but it needs a route and a `get*` helper to surface.

Résumé-style sections (experience, education, awards, certifications, tech stack,
social links, user profile) are the exception: those stay as typed arrays in
`src/features/portfolio/data/`, each with a matching type in `../types/`.

Do not reintroduce a `projects.tsx`-style array for anything that has MDX docs —
project content is single-sourced from `content/work/` on purpose.

## Layout

- `src/app/(app)/(pages)/` — list pages (`/latest`)
- `src/app/(app)/(docs)/` — doc detail routes, both delegate to
  `features/doc/components/doc-page.tsx` for the reading layout
- `src/features/doc/` — content layer, cards, doc shell
- `src/features/portfolio/` — home page sections and their data
- `src/components/` — shared UI; `base/ui/` is Base UI, `ui/` is local
- `src/registry/` — vendored components from the template's registry
- `src/config/site.ts` — nav, site metadata, UTM params
- `src/styles/globals.css` — design tokens, `prose-ncdai`, code-block styles

Import alias is `@/*` → `./src/*`.

## Conventions

- MDX renders through `src/components/mdx.tsx` (GFM, `rehype-pretty-code` +
  shiki, anchored headings). Code-block CSS already exists in `globals.css` and
  expects `rehype-pretty-code`'s markup — don't swap the highlighter casually.
- Markdown bodies must avoid bare `{` and `<`; MDX parses them as JSX.
- Every image path in frontmatter or MDX resolves against `public/`. Check the
  file exists — a missing one renders a broken card, not a build error.
- New sections follow the `Panel` / `PanelHeader` / `PanelTitle` pattern from
  `features/portfolio/components/panel.tsx`.
- Analytics events are a closed enum in `src/lib/events.ts`; add the name there
  before calling `trackEvent`.

## Password gate

`src/proxy.ts` gates every route behind `SITE_PASSWORD`. When the variable
is unset the site is open — that's deliberate, so dev and preview builds work
without a secret. `src/lib/site-auth.ts` holds the token logic; the session
cookie is an expiring HMAC (`<expiry>.<signature>`), not a hash of the password.

Two things to preserve if you touch it: the `?next=` path is validated against
open-redirects in `src/app/api/login/route.ts`, and comparisons go through the
constant-time `safeEqual` rather than `===`.

## Known gaps

- No `/work` index route — cards link straight to `/work/[slug]`.
- A component doc can set `href` in frontmatter to say "my story is told
  elsewhere", and `comingSoon: true` marks one as not yet written. `bab.mdx`
  uses the former (its reference lives in `content/work/bab-design-system.mdx`);
  `iron.mdx` and `modern.mdx` use the latter. On Projects cards, `href`
  already works: `work/fibo.mdx` sends its card to `/fibo`.
  `comingSoon` only matters once the archived Components page is restored.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
